# README

In this example project, we use the New York Times [public COVID-19 dataset](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). Specifically, the [data by county](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties.csv) as of 2020-08-27 was pulled and saved into `data/covid_sample_data_US_counties.csv`.

**WARNING**: If you open the .csv file to explore in Excel, do not save the file using Excel. By default, the program will display and format the date column incorrectly, and may cause the incorrect formatting to carry over if saved. We recommend instead exploring the .csv through a Pandas import in a Jupyter notebook for exploration.
